            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Orde Charles Wingate's life:</h3>
            <ul class="life-time-line">
                <li>
                    <strong>1903</strong> - Born on February 26th at Nainital, United Provinces 
                    of Agra and Oudh, India (now in Uttarakhand, India)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1916</strong> - Moved with his family to Godalming where Wingate 
                    attended Charterhouse as a day boy. He did not board at the school nor did
                     he participate in the activities of a public school education. Instead, 
                     he was kept busy at home by his parents, who encouraged their children to 
                     tackle challenging projects which fostered independent thought, initiative, 
                     and self-reliance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1921</strong> - Accepted at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, 
                    the Royal Artillery's officers' training school.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1923</strong> - Received his Royal Artillery officer's commission 
                    and was posted to the 5th Medium Brigade at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1927</strong> - In June, with Cousin Rex's encouragement, Wingate 
                    obtained six months' leave in order to mount an expedition in the Sudan. Rex 
                    had suggested that he travel via Cairo and then try to obtain secondment to 
                    the Sudan Defence Force. Sending his luggage ahead of him, Wingate set off in 
                    September by bicycle, travelling first through France and Germany before making 
                    his way to Genoa via Czechoslovakia, Austria and Yugoslavia. From Genoa he took 
                    a boat to Egypt. From Cairo he travelled to Khartoum.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1928</strong> - In April his application to transfer to the Sudan Defence 
                    Force came through and he was posted to the East Arab Corps, serving in the area 
                    of Roseires and Gallabat on the borders of Ethiopia, where the SDF patrolled to 
                    catch slave traders and ivory poachers. He changed the method of regular patrolling 
                    to ambushes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1930</strong> - In March, Wingate was given command of a company of 300 
                    soldiers with the local rank of bimbashi (major). He was never happier than when 
                    in the bush with his unit, but when at HQ in Khartoum, he antagonised the other 
                    officers with his aggressive and argumentative personality. He was granted the 
                    local rank of captain in the regular army on 16 April 1930.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1933</strong> - In January, sets off on a short expedition into the Libyan 
                    desert to investigate the lost army of Cambyses, mentioned in the writings of 
                    Herodotus, and to search for the lost oasis of Zerzura. Supported by equipment from 
                    the Royal Geographical Society (the findings of the expedition were published in the 
                    Royal Geographical Magazine in April 1934) and the Sudan Survey Department. He 
                    concluded his service in the Sudan on 2 April 1933.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1935</strong> - From January 13th, Wingate was seconded to the Territorial 
                    Army as the adjutant of the 71st (West Riding) Field Brigade, a Territorial Army unit 
                    of the Royal Artillery, with the temporary rank of captain. On January 24th, married 
                    Lorna Moncrieff Patterson who he met 2 years before on a sea voyage from Egypt, she 
                    was 16yo and travelling with her mother.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1936</strong> - In September, Wingate was assigned to a staff officer position 
                    in the British Mandate of Palestine, and became an intelligence officer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1938</strong> - In June, the new British commander, General Haining, gave his 
                    permission to create the Special Night Squads, armed groups formed of British and Haganah 
                    volunteers. The Jewish Agency helped pay salaries and other costs of the Haganah personnel. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1939</strong> - In May, he was transferred to Britain. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1941</strong> - Gideon force was named after the biblical judge Gideon who defeated 
                    a large force with a tiny band of men.[29] Wingate invited a number of veterans of the 
                    Haganah SNS to join him, with the blessing of Ethiopia's Emperor Haile Selassie, and the group 
                    began to operate in February 1941. On 4 June 1941, Wingate was removed from command of the 
                    dismantled Gideon Force and his rank reduced to that of major. During the campaign, he was 
                    irritated that British authorities ignored a request for decorations for his men. They also 
                    obstructed his efforts to obtain back pay and other compensation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1942</strong> - Wingate was appointed colonel once more by General Wavell upon 
                    arrival in the Far East in March, and he was ordered to organise guerrilla units to fight 
                    behind Japanese lines. However, the precipitate collapse of Allied defences in Burma 
                    forestalled further planning, and he flew back to India in April where he began to promote 
                    his ideas for jungle long-range penetration units. "Never ask favours", he recalled from his 
                    long association with Wavell, "but tell people if they care to help they can come along, that 
                    you yourself are going anyway".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1944</strong> - Killed on Match 24th Near Bishnupur, Manipur State, India (now in 
                    Manipur, India). On his return, flying from Imphal to Lalaghat, the USAAF B-25 Mitchell bomber 
                    of the 1st Air Commando Group in which he was flying crashed into jungle-covered hills.
